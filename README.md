# vscode-extension-starter

This is a simple tool to batch install vscode extensions.

1. change content inside conf/extension to custom your own extension settings, create your own config file and put extension ids inside it.
2. use `extension-loader.sh your-config-file-name` to install deps.
3. use `extension-rm.sh` to **remove** all extensions.
